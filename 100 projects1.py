A website requires the users to input username and password to
register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by
users.
Following are the criteria for checking the password:
1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
3. At least 1 character from [$#@]
4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and
will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match
the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.

You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height)
tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and height are
numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:
1: Sort based on name;
2: Then sort based on age;
3: Then sort by score.
The priority is that name > age > score.
