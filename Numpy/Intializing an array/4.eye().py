# the np.eye() is also one of the function to initialise the values to the array
# here the diagonal elements fills with the 1  and the remaining values are fills with the zeros
# only we have to give the dimension that diagonal matrices(rows and columns should be math,,ex:-2,4,6,8)




import numpy as np
a=np.eye(8)
